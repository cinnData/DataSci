These two are easy, because there is only one `head` node and one `body` node. But there are typically many `div` nodes. So, the XPath expressions can be multivariate, like `/html/body/div`, which denotes, in the example, the two `div` nodes. These nodes can be identified as `/html/body/div[1]` and `/html/body/div[2]`. Note that XPath starts counting at 1, not at 0 like Python.\n",
